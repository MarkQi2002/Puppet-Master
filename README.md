## Puppet-Master

### What it does
It is a device that would help people to move their toes seperately. 


### What we used 
- Arduino
- Servo motors
- Stretch sensors (conductive rubber cords)
- Voltage divider
- Wires and resistors
- Wood frame
- Splitter
- Breadboard
- Fake foot :)
- Nail polish xd

### How we built it
The Arduino board would detect the change in resistance of the stretch sensors from the analog ports, then process (with the help of programming) and transmit the signal to the servo motors. The servos would then turn and pull the strings attachted to it to assist the toes to move seperately, or all together, depending on the input.
